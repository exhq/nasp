# nasp - a selfbot that things ~~different~~ stupid  
one day i was like, why does every selfbot distributes as an exe? so i was like, hey lemme write one in vencord.
this is just a plugin that acts as a selfbot, i think.

**do mind that vendy did say that selfbots are not allowed, but uhhh uhhh idk man**
